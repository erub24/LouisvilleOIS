An interactive Map of Louisville Metro Police Officer Involved Shootings from 2015-2020
This data comes from Louisville Metro Open data (https://data.louisvilleky.gov/)
This is a developing visualization. Currently, viewers can see the officers involved, victims/suspects, their races, sexes, whether the victim/suspect was armed, and what LMPD alleges happened. My ultimate vision for this interactive map is to include links to other public records and descriptions of what happened beyond LMPD's included narrative. I have begun doing this with the cases involving Breonna Taylor and David McAtee, and will continue to periodcially update this map. 

I'm using github to host my code, but it won't display the map. To view th map please visit https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/erub24/LouisvilleOIS/blob/master/OIStest.ipynb
